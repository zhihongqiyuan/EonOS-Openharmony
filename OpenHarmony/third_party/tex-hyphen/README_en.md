## Value Brought to OpenHarmony
**1. Improved Typesetting Quality:** By introducing tex-hyphen, OpenHarmony can achieve more accurate hyphenation, improving the readability and aesthetics of documents.  
**2. Enhanced Small Screen Experience:** Using hyphenation patterns on small screen devices can display more content in the same area, enhancing the reading experience.

## How to Use tex-hyphen in OpenHarmony
### 1. Compile the HPB Binary
#### Compilation Steps
Open the terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the directory containing the [hyphen_pattern_processor.cpp](ohos%2Fsrc%2Fhyphen-build%2Fhyphen_pattern_processor.cpp) file, and run the following command to compile the code:

```
cd ohos/src/hyphen-build/
g++ -g -Wall hyphen_pattern_processor.cpp -o transform
```

Explanation of the command:
- g++: Invoke the GCC compiler.
- -g: Add debugging information.
- -Wall: Enable all warnings.
- hyphen_pattern_processor.cpp: Source code file.
- -o transform: Specify the output executable file name as transform.

#### Execution Steps
After compilation, you can run the generated executable file and process the specified .tex file using the following command:

```
./transform hyph-en-us.tex ./out/
```

Explanation of the command:
- ./transform: Run the generated transform executable file.
- hyph-en-us.tex: Input file (the .tex file to be processed).
- ./out/: Output directory (the processed files will be stored in this directory).

After successful execution, the processed files will be stored in the ./out/ directory.

#### Batch Compilation
- Dependencies:
```
jq:JSON file parsing tool
```
- Configure the files to be compiled using the JSON configuration file [build-tex.json](ohos%2Fbuild%2Fbuild-tex.json):
```
[
    {
        "filename": "example1.tex"
    },
    {
        "filename": "example2.tex"
    }
]
```
filename: Specifies the name of the TeX file to be compiled. The file must be located in the [tex](hyph-utf8%2Ftex%2Fgeneric%2Fhyph-utf8%2Fpatterns%2Ftex) directory.  

The build-tex.json file defines all supported languages, and the script will compile all of them by default. Developers can control the addition or removal of languages by modifying build-tex.json.   
For example:  
To remove the example2 language, modify the file as follows:
```
[
    {
        "filename": "example1.tex"
    }
]
```
To add the example3 language, modify the file as follows:
```
[
    {
        "filename": "example1.tex"
    },
    {
        "filename": "example2.tex"
    },
    {
        "filename": "example3.tex"
    }
]
```

- Open a terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the directory containing the [build.sh](ohos%2Fbuild%2Fbuild.sh) file, and run the following commands to compile the code:
```
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
After successful compilation, the compiled output will be placed in the ./out_hpb directory.
### 2. Parse Word Hyphenation Positions Using HPB
#### compilation Steps
Open a terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the directory containing the [hyphen_pattern_reader.cpp](ohos%2Fsrc%2Fhyphen-build%2Fhyphen_pattern_reader.cpp) file, and run the following command to compile the code:

```
cd ohos/src/hyphen-build/
g++ -g -Wall hyphen_pattern_reader.cpp -o reader
```
Explanation of the command:
- g++: Calls the GCC compiler.
- -g: Adds debugging information.
- -Wall: Enables all warnings.
- hyphen_pattern_reader.cpp: The source code file.
- -o reader: Specifies the output executable file name as reader.

#### Running Steps
After compilation, you can parse the hyphenation positions of words in the specified language using the following command:

```
./reader hyph-en-us.hpb helloworld
```
Explanation of the command:
- ./reader: Runs the generated reader executable.
- hyph-en-us.hpb: The input file (the binary file to be parsed).
- helloworld: The word to be parsed.

After successful execution, the log will output the hyphenation information of the parsed word.

### 3. Batch Verification 
You can use the [generate_report.py](ohos%2Ftest%2Fgenerate_report.py) Python script to read the [report_config.json](ohos%2Ftest%2Freport_config.json) configuration file and perform batch verification to check the validity of the generated binary files.  
#### Preparation
- Python 3.x
- transform and reader executables, placed in the same directory as the script.
- report_config.json configuration file

#### Usage
1. Prepare the Configuration File First, create a JSON configuration file named report_config.json with the following content:
```
{
    "file_path": "path/to/tex/files",
    "tex_files": [
        {
            "filename": "example.tex",
            "words": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4", "word5", "word6", "word7", "word8", "word9", "word10"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
2. Run the Script Run the following command in the terminal:
```
python generate_report.py report_config.json
```
3. Log Files The script will generate a timestamped subdirectory under the report directory, containing the following log files:
```
match.log: Records successful matches.
unmatch.log: Records unsuccessful matches.
```
